          <p>The first, and possibly the most important of the list, is keeping your passwords secure. Choosing long, unpredictable passwords is paramount to your safety on the internet.

It is recommended that you change your passwords on any important accounts every 2 to 3 months.

          <h1 class ="page-title">Suspicious Emails</h1>
          <p>Knowing how to identify and avoid suspicious emails is vital to you and your device's safety. Scammers often use a tactic known as "phishing" a method of scamming that aims to trick you into giving them your personal information through a convicing emails. These emails may take the form of your employer, large companies, or even the government. Although these emails can be very convincing, it is possible to discern these scams through a number of tactics. Most phishing emails will ask for confirmation of personal information that could leave you vulnurable. No matter who the email is supposed to be sent from, you should never give personal information directly to someone sending an email. If you cannot discern wheter the email is a scam, send an email (don't reply to the original) to the company the "scam" claims to be from inquiring as to whether they sent the email.

          <h1 class ="page-title">Anti-virus</h1>
          <p>During modern-day web broswing, having an anti-virus installed on your machine is a must in order to be safe on the internet. Anti-viruses keep dangerous pieces of software from being downloaded on your computer without your knowledge, and filter through the ones that you download willingly. Anti-viruses also have the ability to sipher through your computer's contents in order to see if your device is currently infected with any malware, and remove it if that is the case. While many anti-viruses require payment, there are lots of great versions you can install for free.

          <h1 class ="page-title">In Person Exchanges</h1>
          <p>Websites like Craigslist are great for finding cheap used items in your area, but you must be extrewmely careful when performing these exchanges. Needless to say, there are lots of people out there willing to take advantage of someone just looking for a ware on the internet. When making a sale on a website like Craigslist, it is advised to go with a friend, and make sure the meeting place is a public, well-lit area. Fast-food restuauruants that are always busy like McDonalds work well for the job. Remember to always put safety first in any meetup with a stranger.

          <h1 class ="page-title">Online Shopping</h1>
          <p>Everyone loves online shopping. Browsing and purchasing any product imaginable from the comfort of your couch is a luxury, but not one that comes without its risks. Tens of thousands of online shopping scams are commited each year, most of which can be prevented by some good detective work. Using a reputable retailer such as Amazon assures that you're getting what you've been promised, and in the rare case this doesn't happen, Amazon will try to make things right. If using a popular retailer isn't possible, it is imperative to do outside research on your own.

          <h1 class ="page-title">Suspicious Websites</h1>
          <p>If it seems too good to be true, it probably is. This is a good rule to live by on the internet, as you'll often come across websites that try to convince you otherwise. Whether you're being told you won the lottery, a new iPhone, or a luxury vacation, you're being lied to. Upon coming across a site like these, you should immediately close it out without clicking anywhere on the page. These websites are almost always hiding malware behind those big buttons, and that's the last thing you want on your computer.

          <h1 class ="page-title">Update Software</h1>
          <p>Making sure your software stays up to date is a great way to keep your device safe. When an application discovers a security breach or severe bug, they will typically immediately send out an update fixing the issue. However, if you don't update the software the bug will remain in your version of the product. Frequently checking applications for updates is a good way to keep an unwanted security breach from happening.
