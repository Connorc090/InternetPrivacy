          How often do you spend online each day?
        </h2>
          <h3 class="answers">
            I probably spend two to four hours on the internet per day.

        <h2 class="questions">
          How safe do you think you are when on the internet? 
        </h2>
          <h3 class="answers">
            I like to believe I’m safe, but I also know I probably don’t do everything I should do to protect myself
          </h3>
        <h2 class="questions">
          Do you take precautions to protect yourself electronically, such as installing an antivirus?
        </h2>
          <h3 class="answers">
            No. Not beyond what’s built in to my computer.

        <h2 class="questions">
          When you think of a hacker, what image first comes to mind?

          <h3 class="answers">
            (laughs) Someone a lot smarter than me, in a dark room, figuring out how to get around firewalls and other protections put in place by companies.

        <h2 class="questions">
          Have you heard of Facebook’s recent privacy violations?
        </h2>
          <h3 class="answers">
            Yes I have.
          </h3>
        <h2 class="questions">
          If so, what are your opinions on them?
        </h2>
          <h3 class="answers">
            I don’t know a lot of the details about it, but I do know that over and over again they say they’re fixing it, and it seems they’re talking more than they are acting. It’s scary lots of people have their entire lives on there and it’s not as safe as it should be.
          </h3>
        <h2 class="questions">
          How much of a role do you think our government should have in protecting our internet privacy?
        </h2>
          <h3 class="answers">
            Oh boy, that’s a tough one. I do believe in certain broad protections the government should provide, but I think individuals have the ultimate responsibility to protect themselves. I think some basic protection from the government is a good place to start.

              I’d say about five to six hours.

              Not too safe.

              I think there should be some element of protection from the government, but our internet privacy should not be entirely controlled by the government.

        Analysis
      </h1>
        <h2>
          Although the sample size was small, I was able to make a few observations on different age groups and their perception on internet safety. Both participants spend a moderate amount of time on the internet, although exactly what they are doing was not made clear. Neither take any precautions against computer viruses, a mistake that is evident by the state of Renn's computer. When speaking about the Facebook allegations, Renn had heard them briefly on the news, while Hayden had not heard of them at all. Although this is understandable because neither of them actively use Facebook, I assumed they would have been a little better informed on the issue, since it was frontline news for many weeks. Both interviewees have a very similar opinion on how much the government should regulate their internet privacy: they should have a part in it without completely controlling it. This is an opinion I believe many Americans share, because while most people want basic protection from their government, they don't want to be controlled by it.
